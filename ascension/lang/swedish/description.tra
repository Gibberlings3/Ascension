@1 = ~Ethereal

Imoen is now able to enter the Ethereal Plane for brief periods of time. The ability is useable once every minute, and its use prevents her from assuming the Slayer form for a minute, as well. Imoen can remain fully ethereal and intangible to forces on this plane for a full round... during which she is invisible and completely immune to harm. During that round, she also cannot cast spells or use abilities.

For another two rounds afterwards, Imoen remains 'half-phased'... she is partially ethereal and partially in this plane. She is still invisible, but takes half damage from all sources. In this state, there is a small chance (10%) that she will miscast a spell. For all three rounds, she is able to see any invisible targets.~
@6 = ~End Slayer Change

This ability allows Imoen to cancel her transformation and return to her usual form.~
@7 = ~Regeneration

Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/ 2 levels
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None

This powerful ability enables the Bhaalspawn to imbue 1 creature with the ability to regenerate. This regeneration will heal any wounds and even regenerate lost limbs. The creature affected will regain 3 hit points per second. The effect lasts for 1 round per every 2 levels of the caster or until dispelled. For example, a 14th level character would regenerate 18 hit points per round for 7 rounds.~
@8 = ~Resurrection

Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature Touched
Saving Throw: None

Like the 5th level spell Raise Dead, Resurrection will return a character back to life. However, Resurrection also heals the character so that they are ready for the adventuring life once more.~
@9 = ~Slayer Change

When you use this ability, you take on the form of the brutal essence of Bhaal: a violent, powerful creature made of teeth and claws.

- Effective AC set to -9
- Magic Resistance set to 40%

- THAC0 set to 0
- PLUS_SIGN_PLACEHOLDER 100 Hit Points

Perhaps because Imoen has less of Bhaal's essence than <CHARNAME> - or perhaps because of what she learned after Melissan called forth her essence - she is more able to contain the Slayer's power, and has no chance of losing control while in Slayer form.~
@14 = ~Bhaalspawn powers granted~
@15 = ~Imoen can now change into the Slayer at will, and can enter the Ethereal plane once per minute~

The Bhaalspawn engages the demon in mental combat for DURATION_PLACEHOLDER seconds, at the end of which the demon has a SUCCESS_CHANCE_PLACEHOLDER% chance of becoming an ally. (There is no further saving throw, nor is magic resistance checked.) The demon is not under the Bhaalspawn's direct control, however. This ability may be used once every 3 rounds.~
@17 = ~Unleash

Range: 5ft
Casting Time: 1
Duration: Instant
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2 plus special

The "Unleash" ability releases your inner power upon a target that is within melee range, hitting them for DICENUMBER_PLACEHOLDERd12 magic damage (half on a successful save vs. Death at -4) and sending them flying back and perhaps unconscious for a short period. This ability may only be used once ever thirty seconds... and after using it the Bhaalspawn will be incredibly fatigued, and have a 25% miscast chance on all spells, for 2 rounds. Due to the amount of divine essence used, the Slayer form will also not be available for thirty seconds.~

Range: 0
Casting Time: 1
Duration: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This ability allows the Bhaalspawn to focus <PRO_HISHER> energy within <PRO_HIMHER> to resist spell effects from without.

Area of Effect: Balthazar, plus any creatures within 30ft
Saving Throw: None

By entering the Solar Stance, Balthazar calls on the power of the sun to enhance his mystical abilities.

Upon entering the Solar Stance, Balthazar releases a blast of flame which deals 12d6 fire damage (save vs. spell for 1/2) and 1d8 crushing damage to all with 30ft, blasting any nearby creatures away from him.
