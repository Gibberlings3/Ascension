"The perils that Mazzy Fentan faced at the side of <CHARNAME> did nothing to "
"dissuade her thirst for adventure. In fact, it was not long after the events"
" in Tethyr that she formed the Fentan Knights, a stalwart band of heroes "
"that spawned tales across the Realms. Always Mazzy invoked the name of "
"<CHARNAME> when urging her comrades to valour, or when they battled doubt "
"and temptation. <CHARNAME> was the greatest <PRO_MANWOMAN> that Mazzy had "
"ever known, and the halfling knight felt it was her duty to try to live up "
"to her old friend's legacy. The Fentan Knights battled trolls to save "
"endangered towns, turned back tides of orcs to preserve ancient forests, and"
" faced a rogue dragon in its own lair just to make the world a better place."
" Their legend was larger than life, especially so for Mazzy, and it was said"
" on occasion that if valor were inches, she'd be twenty feet tall. It was "
"well known that Mazzy's crowning achievement was the day she was annointed "
"an honorary paladin in the great hall of the Radiant Heart. The first "
"halfling ever to do so, indeed the first non-human, Mazzy's quiet tears of "
"pride flowed freely down her face as the aged Prelate laid the Order's "
"greatest honors across her shoulders. It was said that Mazzy scanned the "
"crowd often during the ceremony, and for all the old friends that had been "
"able to attend, the face she looked for most was <CHARNAME>'s. For all her "
"risks, Mazzy eventually passed peacefully at a ripe old age. She had never "
"settled down and had no children, but her legacy was one that would go on to"
" inspire her people for generations to come."

"Nalia grew quite powerful after her association with <CHARNAME>. Initially she traveled, slaking her thirst for magical lore by associating with some of the greatest wizards across the Realms. She sought to use her great power to bring justice to the land, but over time found that if her time with <CHARNAME> had taught her anything, it is that such power must be tempered with wisdom or it is useless. She could strike out at evil as she wished... it did not always help the needy, as she thought it would, and after a year of travel she remembered that there was a far better way that she could be of service to her people.\n"
"Nalia returned to Amn and her family home of de'Arnise Hold. She found it in the control of none other than Isaea Roenal, but she was no longer the wayward child that he expected, and single-handedly brought him to justice for his indiscretions. She declared herself the inheritor of her father's ducal title, and for once there was no argument from the local nobility. They snubbed her and her magic, and initially rejoiced when the Cowled Wizards sought to remove her from power. Nalia demonstrated to them all that she was no-one to trifle with, however, and the Cowled Wizards learned to fear her name. Over time Nalia became a beloved ruler, respected archmage, and eventually earned a seat on the Amnish Council of Six itself. The nobility grew to rely on Nalia's leadership, and she would become a prominent figure in Amn for many years, constantly fighting for the good of the common folk and making many frustrated enemies among the nobility and Cowled Wizards both. Nalia would die many years later, surrounded by a loving family... her last words would be to thank <CHARNAME> for so long ago showing her the true path she needed to walk."

"Upon parting ways with <CHARNAME>, the reborn Sarevok proved as good as his word. He returned to the lands he once knew, far more powerful now than he was even before. Old enemies were startled by his visits, but never for long, and it was not even months later that Sarevok would start a reign of terror in Baldur's Gate that would place him completely in charge of the city. Resistance was crushed as Sarevok began raising an army for conquest in his own name. If he could not have the divine power of his father, he would have enough earthly power to satiate his appetite. Sarevok partook of women as he pleased as his name became a bitter epithet on the tongue of every citizen of the Sword Coast.\n"
"The first victims of his terrible army fell easily, and Sarevok's power grew. The warrior was maddened, however, to find that the victories gave him no thrill. The power tasted as ashes, though Sarevok tried many times to drive himself into a frenzy of delight at his achievements. In the end, his throne grew heavy, and it was with dread acceptance that he greeted the arrival of the inevitable heroes to displace him not a year after his return.\n"
"Sarevok fled into the night, abandoning Baldur's Gate and his dreams of power both. He became a man haunted by his second chance, hunted by a former life that never was and a possible life that never could be. Without a destiny and or a true soul of his own, he wandered the Realms... sometimes he brought terror and sometimes he brought nothing but his tired heart, and before long he was gone forever. Some say that he found his purpose in the great desert, forging a kingdom to last an age. Some say he traveled to the planes, launching a campaign against the great Mount Celestia. The truth is unknown, though the tales still persist."

It is said that Viconia saved the elves of Suldanessellar from a Zhentarim plot, fighting valiantly against the organization's agents... and in the end placing herself in harm's way to save Queen Ellesime from a deadly arrow. Upon being revived, Viconia was surprised to discover that this last act had prompted the Suldanessellar elves to finally accept and forgive their drow sister. Queen Ellesime granted the highest honors of the Seldarine to Viconia, the first drow ever honored so, and even invited Viconia to find a home in the Tree of Life once again. Viconia was obviously moved by the gesture... and while she considered the Queen's offer, it is said she eventually merely bowed deeply to Ellesime and silently left Suldanessellar forever.

"After the events of the Bhaalspawn Saga, Rasaad yn Bashir was no longer "

"hundred Sun Soul monks before succumbing to their superior numbers. Haraan "
"Sixscar herself struck the final blow. In the aftermath of Rasaad's death, "

"Among those who speak the animal tongues, the name of Wilson is well-known "

"a violent world, Wilson's courage and heroism inspired many in the animal "
"kingdom to follow in his footsteps. The legend, passed down through the "
"generations, grows with each telling. After ending his own kind's murderous "
