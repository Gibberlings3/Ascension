She became the confidante of Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun and was oft-associated with a tale involving the great Elminster, supposedly picking the sage's pocket one day and then leading him on a merry magical chase across Faerun for four months. The exact truth of the tale is unknown... though it's certainly not unlike Imoen to encourage an old codger to not be such a stick-in-the-mud, and her later friendship with Elminster is well-documented. Later tales say Imoen founded a thieves guild that operated all the way to Neverwinter, sparred with the Shadow Thieves and the Zhentarim and even duelled a dragon because (so the story goes) \"he was rude\". At times, Imoen was known to think back on her old friend, <CHARNAME>, and smile sadly... and then immediately be possessed with a wickedly funny thought that would propel her onto her next scheme.

"Nalia grew quite powerful after her association with <CHARNAME>. Initially she traveled, slaking her thirst for magical lore by associating with some of the greatest wizards across the Realms. She sought to use her great power to bring justice to the land, but over time found that if her time with <CHARNAME> had taught her anything, it is that such power must be tempered with wisdom or it is useless. She could strike out at evil as she wished... it did not always help the needy, as she thought it would, and after a year of travel she remembered that there was a far better way that she could be of service to her people.\n"
"Nalia returned to Amn and her family home of de'Arnise Hold. She found it in the control of none other than Isaea Roenal, but she was no longer the wayward child that he expected, and single-handedly brought him to justice for his indiscretions. She declared herself the inheritor of her father's ducal title, and for once there was no argument from the local nobility. They snubbed her and her magic, and initially rejoiced when the Cowled Wizards sought to remove her from power. Nalia demonstrated to them all that she was no-one to trifle with, however, and the Cowled Wizards learned to fear her name. Over time Nalia became a beloved ruler, respected archmage, and eventually earned a seat on the Amnish Council of Six itself. The nobility grew to rely on Nalia's leadership, and she would become a prominent figure in Amn for many years, constantly fighting for the good of the common folk and making many frustrated enemies among the nobility and Cowled Wizards both. Nalia would die many years later, surrounded by a loving family... her last words would be to thank <CHARNAME> for so long ago showing her the true path she needed to walk."

"Upon parting ways with <CHARNAME>, the reborn Sarevok proved as good as his word. He returned to the lands he once knew, far more powerful now than he was even before. Old enemies were startled by his visits, but never for long, and it was not even months later that Sarevok would start a reign of terror in Baldur's Gate that would place him completely in charge of the city. Resistance was crushed as Sarevok began raising an army for conquest in his own name. If he could not have the divine power of his father, he would have enough earthly power to satiate his appetite. Sarevok partook of women as he pleased as his name became a bitter epithet on the tongue of every citizen of the Sword Coast.\n"
"The first victims of his terrible army fell easily, and Sarevok's power grew. The warrior was maddened, however, to find that the victories gave him no thrill. The power tasted as ashes, though Sarevok tried many times to drive himself into a frenzy of delight at his achievements. In the end, his throne grew heavy, and it was with dread acceptance that he greeted the arrival of the inevitable heroes to displace him not a year after his return.\n"
"Sarevok fled into the night, abandoning Baldur's Gate and his dreams of power both. He became a man haunted by his second chance, hunted by a former life that never was and a possible life that never could be. Without a destiny and or a true soul of his own, he wandered the Realms... sometimes he brought terror and sometimes he brought nothing but his tired heart, and before long he was gone forever. Some say that he found his purpose in the great desert, forging a kingdom to last an age. Some say he traveled to the planes, launching a campaign against the great Mount Celestia. The truth is unknown, though the tales still persist."

"芭荻终于品尝到了以<CHARNAME>的灵魂形成的神性之力，然而在这种力量的痕迹随着时间消逝以后，芭荻开始沉浸于那不属于自己的神性。那种执意要再次获得那份力量的执着，使她又一次陷入了痛苦与憎恨之中。芭荻为了满足对混乱与死亡的饥渴，开始用剑湾人民的鲜血沐浴，这造成了人们极大的恐慌，有些村落甚至把人绑在路边作为对黑暗的祭品。在由各种神殿组织的多次徒劳无功的追捕中，许多前往的高级牧师都被吸干了血，极度的恐惧和痛苦的表情凝固在他们没有血色的脸上。芭荻的名字也因此成了恐怖与死亡的代名词。但是，随着时间的推移，她感觉到冰冷的诅咒日渐加强，这种绝望与恐惧使她对混乱的渴望变得麻木，同时使她求生的欲望变得更加强烈。这种对力量渴求的野心，曾经促使她引诱艾瑞尼卡斯堕落，如今又驱使她回到了很久以前称之为家的地方：索丹尼斯拉。在精灵国度的入口，芭荻遇到了精灵女王艾丽星。但是，生命之树的能量与艾丽星对艾瑞尼卡斯的回忆交织在一起构成了正义的复仇：当最后一根木桩插入那颗死后仍遭天谴的黑心时，芭荻的生命终于走到了尽头。"
