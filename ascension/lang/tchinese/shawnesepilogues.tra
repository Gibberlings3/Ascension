@4002 = ~Aerie and <CHARNAME> would prove inseparable, journeying together with their wide-eyed son always in tow¡CBefore long, little Quayle had a sister with whom to share the delights of his parents' exploits¡CThe family's later years would hold one last great trek, however, as Aerie was still tormented by memories of her enslavement and the loss of her wings¡CShe and <CHARNAME> sought out her people, the winged avariel of Faenya-Dail, and there they found not only a warm welcome but Aerie's loving parents, who had never given up hope of finding their child¡CWith the pain of their respective pasts laid to rest, it was there among the clouds that Aerie and <CHARNAME> were finally married¡CIt is said that their union was blessed by both Aerdrie Faenya and Baervan Wildwanderer.~
@4003 = ~Though they had gone their separate ways, Anomen Delryn's time with <CHARNAME> still weighed heavily on his soul¡CHe had witnessed the power of a dark god's taint firsthand, and his faith in Helm was shaken¡CFor years, Anomen traveled without aim, until he reached the borders of Maztica¡CThis was during the revolt of Yamash, an evil cleric who had summoned a conquering horde of demons to ravage the land¡CAnomen was drawn into the conflict, and did what he could to organize the besieged Maztican soldiers¡CBut in training them, he spoke of duty and the role a guardian must play: he was teaching the doctrine of Helm, and understanding it more clearly than he ever had¡CIn the battle that followed, Anomen sought out Yamash and faced him in single combat¡CHe did not falter, and Maztica was saved¡CTo this day, the Disciples of Anomen watch over the land.~
@4004 = ~Many were the achievements of Anomen Delryn, the Shining Knight, and his much-renowned lady¡CThey were known as heroes almost everywhere they went, and the cheers of their admirers drowned out any whispers pertaining to <CHARNAME>'s heritage¡CSo prolific were their deeds that their wedding was constantly delayed, either due to some impending crisis or a lucrative mission that one or the other would insist on investigating¡CFinally, a day approached that both <CHARNAME> and her beloved were determined to keep¡CThe heralded event drew heroes and dignitaries in droves from across Faerun, and Elminster himself united the lovers in one of the grandest ceremonies the city of Baldur's Gate had ever hosted¡C<CHARNAME> and Anomen withdrew from public life shortly thereafter, though if tales be true, their adventures never truly ended¡CIn time, their daughter Moira would forge her own legend.~
@4005 = ~With his guidance no longer needed, Cernd left <CHARNAME> and reunited with his son Ahsdale¡CBut his duty to nature constantly called him away, and the boy grew bitter and resentful¡CYears later, Cernd attained the title of Grand Druid, only to stop the ceremony when he learned that his long-estranged child now wielded twisted magics which threatened the Sword Coast¡CCernd solemnly abdicated his position, declaring that he could not hold such responsibility when he had been so grossly negligent in his personal obligations¡CDeep in the forests of Tethyr, the druid made a final effort to appeal to his son¡CBut they were strangers to each other, and neither would survive when they finally met in battle¡CThe only common ground between father and son was the spot where they fell, and where a wondrous oak now stands¡CIt turns the deepest shades of red at season's change, a reminder that balance sometimes comes at a terrible cost.~
@4006 = ~Edwin Odesseiron gained great renown in his travels with <CHARNAME>, and in the years following their association he would exploit that infamy¡CIn time, he achieved enough influence to subjugate even the Red Wizards themselves, becoming the greatest leader they had known in recent memory¡CVery recent memory, it turns out, as he was deposed scant days later¡CSuch is the brief nature of conquerors in Thay, practically lining up for their turn in power¡CHis only notable appearance following this embarrassment was in battle with Elminster of Shadowdale himself, a short affair that saw the end of Edwin's existence in the Realms¡CEdwina, however, tends bar in a Waterdeep tavern¡CShe is a bitter, bitter woman.~
@4007 = ~Haer'Dalis found his time with <CHARNAME> a fine introduction to the Realms, and once they parted, he was eager to see more¡CHe visited such varied locales as Waterdeep, Neverwinter and Thaymount, fleeing each one in turn after innocently immersing himself in local troubles¡CLater, he befriended a female cambion and returned with her to the Abyss, only to unintentionally launch a revolt across several of the Infinite Layers¡CFor a time, Haer'Dalis was the most hunted man in the Planes, rumored to be pursued by Graz'zt himself¡CBut the ire of his enemies could not match his wanderlust, and he finally found his way back to the city of Sigil, unharmed in any permanent fashion¡CThere he rejoined his beloved Raelis and her acting troupe, and was pleased to finally settle down..¡Cuntil the next misunderstanding, of course.~
@4008 = ~And what of the eternally-playful Imoen? She had long stood in the shadow of <CHARNAME>, and had endured much, but her spirit never broke¡CFree of her father's legacy, she struck out on her own and briefly returned to Candlekeep¡CHer formidable knowledge of magic allowed a deeper appreciation of the great library, but it seemed smaller than she remembered, and she did not stay long¡CImoen would use different names throughout her life, and was the subject of many a tall tale - perhaps the most memorable claiming that she'd picked the pocket of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, leading him on a merry magical chase across Faerun that lasted four months¡CAnother rumor claimed she'd founded a thieves' guild that ran the length and breadth of the entire Sword Coast, from Nashkel to Neverwinter¡CBut when asked of such things, she would always answer with a smile of purest innocence: "Heya, it's just me, Imoen".~
@4009 = ~The events of the Bhaalspawn Crisis affected Jaheira deeply¡CAs a druid, it was her duty to protect and maintain balance in the world, but her time with <CHARNAME> had led to great change and disruption, and she herself had experienced terrible loss as a result¡CYet she remained a tireless champion, at times even acting in concert with her former associates the Harpers¡CAlways she remained distant and guarded, never staying long in any one place¡CSome say Alustriel Silverhand herself persuaded Jaheira to form her own organization, one that would eventually eclipse the accomplishments of the Harpers¡COthers believe she fell in battle against a demilich who threatened to defile the northern forests¡CWhatever her fate, Jaheira never returned to Tethyr or the Sword Coast.~
@4010 = ~The years following the Bhaalspawn Crisis were kind to Jaheira¡CThey couldn't be called peaceful by any means, but her relationship with <CHARNAME> weathered each challenge¡CTheirs was an unshakable union, and while duty or adventure might separate them for a time, they would inevitably return to one another¡CTheir friends marveled at the certainty of their bond, especially considering Jaheira's initial reluctance to be with <CHARNAME>¡CBut she would chuckle when thinking back on those first cautious days: after all, they had literally been to the Hells and back, and if the gods themselves couldn't separate the two, what were simple months and miles? Jaheira became known as a great heroine and mediator, finding success in Neverwinter, Rashemen, the southern steppes and even the jungles of Chult¡CShe lived long and well, not always at <CHARNAME>'s side or sharing in his victories, but never truly apart from him.~
@4011 = ~Jan Jansen's life following his time with <CHARNAME> was unsurprisingly convoluted, the barest of details hidden amidst half-truths and whole lies¡CAccording to his published memoirs, "A Jansen in Every Port", Jan's short prison term for monkey smuggling led him to return to his first love: monkey smuggling¡CIt was believed he was the cause of the now-infamous Gibbon Riot of '72, a tumultuous and altogether unclean event that seemed to center on the estate of the Shadow Thief Vaelag¡CJan denied planning the rogue's downfall, but could not explain what practical application he may intended for a horde of knife-wielding simians¡CNevertheless, Vaelag's death could not be linked to the young gnome, as Jan had alibis for each and every second of the day in question¡CAnd what a day it must have been!

@4012 = ~Keldorn Firecam thought his travels with <CHARNAME> marked the end of his active career, both as an adventurer and as a member of the Radiant Heart¡CHe retired to Athkatla, hoping to live in as much peace as an old warrior could expect, but the call to serve would come one last time, years later, as Amn was besieged by giants¡CIn his sixtieth winter, Keldorn and five other knights held a strategic pass until the main Amnish force could arrive¡CHe won the day, but his wounds were too severe and the old paladin fell on the battlefield¡CAs his companions watched, the hand of Torm descended upon the scene, and when it departed, Keldorn was gone¡CFrom that day, visions of the deity were accompanied by a stalwart form in gleaming armor, ever at his right hand.~

@4014 = ~The perils that Mazzy Fentan faced at the side of <CHARNAME> did nothing to dissuade her thirst for adventure. In fact, it was not long after the events in Tethyr that she formed the Fentan Knights, a stalwart band of heroes that spawned tales across the Realms. They battled trolls to save endangered towns, turned back tides of orcs to preserve ancient forests, and faced a rogue dragon in its own lair just to make the world a better place. Their legend was larger than life, especially so for Mazzy, and it was said on occasion that if valor were inches, she'd be twenty feet tall. For all her risks, Mazzy passed peacefully at a ripe old age. And though she had never settled down and had no children, her name and legacy would live on in the deeds of her followers for generations to come.~

@4017 = ~The reborn Sarevok Anchev proved true to his word: he returned to the lands he once knew, far mightier than he had ever been¡COld enemies were startled by his visits - though never for very long - and soon enough Sarevok began a reign of terror in Baldur's Gate that placed him in complete control of the city¡CAs his power grew and all resistance was crushed under his heel, the Deathbringer was maddened to find no thrill in victory¡CWithin a year, his rule was nothing more than a burden, one he gladly relinquished when a group of heroes arrived to overthrow him¡CFleeing into the night, Sarevok became a man haunted by his lack of purpose, by the unknown destiny that had once been so clear to him¡CSome say he traveled to the wastes of Anauroch, seeking to forge a new kingdom on the bones of the Netheril, others claim he slipped through the bonds of Toril and into the Planes, launching a campaign against Mount Celestia itself¡CThe truth remains unknown, but tales of Sarevok's power and depravity will persist for centuries to come.~
@4018 = ~In the years following his resurrection by <CHARNAME>, Sarevok Anchev never settled anywhere for long. In Berdusk, he is said to have routed an army of invading orcs, displaying such power and rage that terrified locals weren't sure whom to fear more. In Westgate, he arrived as conqueror, brutally enforcing his will only to mysteriously vanish weeks later, leaving his startled followers to the mercies of an angry mob. He acted like a man that did not know himself, and it became abundantly clear that Sarevok was a tortured soul caught between life and death, unable to appreciate either. Eventually he disappeared entirely from Faerun, and was thought to have taken his own life. In truth, he journeyed to Kara-Tur to bury his one true love, the warrior Tamoko. He never returned, though the stories endure.~

@4024 = ~In the end, it was Bodhi's ambition that sealed her fate¡CHer dealings with <CHARNAME> had given her a brief taste of divinity, and when it faded she became obsessed with recapturing that glory¡CShe stalked the shadows of the Sword Coast, bathing in the blood of countless victims, and every attempt to hunt her down ended the same way: with the drained corpses of clerics and knights scattered about, and no trace of the vampire herself¡CBut this time Bodhi's thirst was without end, without satisfaction¡CAt last her frenzy drove her back to Suldanessellar, and at the gates of the city she found Ellesime waiting for her¡CThey fought all through the night, both driven by memories of the past, until Bodhi's fangs found the queen's throat just as a stake pierced her black heart¡CAs Bodhi fell to dust for the last time, she could hear her brother's voice raised in mocking laughter, following her into oblivion.~
